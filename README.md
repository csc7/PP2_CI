# *Sorry, website under construction*

# Wavelet Website

This website is about wavelet theory and generation. Except for the content referenced in this README file and/or the code and/or the website, all content is invented by me, anything matching reality is just a coincidence.

This repository belongs to my second milestone project in the Full-stack Development course at Code Institute, covering HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with Git version control and other software technologies.

The live link for this project is this one (https://csc7.github.io/PP2_CI_WW/).

# **1 . Project Goals**
The goal of the project is to develop a website where seismic data processors, signal processors and/or any user can estimate, visualize and download a simple file with the samples of a wavelet that they want to use in their processing tasks. In addition, a website where users can view and review the theory and formulas of wavelets, challenge their knowledge against a quiz, and contact the website developer.

Specifically, the goals of the project are the following ones:
- To .....

# **2 . User Experience**

UX has been addressed (and remains as a constant activity) around Jesse James Garrett's process, whose five planes involves the following matters:
- **STRATEGY**: to build a website (product) for a company who wants to sell services.
- **SCOPE**: the minimum viable product needs to include features that allow the user to know the following:
    - Basic organisational information about the company.
    - Which services it provides.
    - How to contact the company.
    - How to request services.
    - Be informed about the latest news.
- **STRUCTURE**: the information is structured as follows:
    - Basic organisational information about the company: in a separate page.
    - Services it provides, in a separate page.
    - How to contact the company: both in a separate page and in a fixed button.
    - How to request services: in a fixed button.
    - Be informed about the latest news: in the home page.
- **SKELETON**: the information is accessed through a fixed navigation menu on top of the pages, which in addition has a button to request services.
- **SURFACE**: the website is based on green colours (to be in line with the company activity and name), contains images and a video related to its activity, and will summarise information in tables as much as possible.

- ### **Returning users**
10. As a client, I want to be updated with the latest news of the company, in order to know company's performance and understand current and future capabilities.
11. asdfasfasdfasd

- ### **Organisation/Site Owner**
14. As owner, I want to briefly show my services, so I promote our company and clients know what can be hired.

- ### **Body**

The body of the pages are structured as follows for each of the pages:
- #### *Theory:*
    It contains asdfsdfsdfsdf.
- #### *Generator:*
    It has an upper section, asdfsdfsf.
- #### *Quiz:*
    It contains pictures in a carousel (taken from Bootstrap, asdfsdfsdfsobile devices.
- #### *Contact:*
    On the left, there is a forasdfsdfsdfe.

- ### **Footer**

The footer contains links for social media (LinkedIn and GitHub) and e-mail. It is designed to remain fixed at the bottom of the webpages in order to have the links always visible to promote the developer of the website.\

# **7 . Validation**

The introductory image on top of this README file was generated using the [Am I Responsive site](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcsc7.github.io%2FPP1_CI_TGC) to test how the website displays in different screen sizes.

Development tools of Google Chrome (Version 91.0.sdfsdfs, Official Build, 64-bit), Microsoft Edge (Version 91.0.asdfsdf, Official build, 64-bit) and Firefox (89.0.asdfsd, 64-bit) have been used to test the behaviour of the website for screen sizes between 320x568px to 1920x1370px.

The website was tested using these browsers and also Microsoft Internet Explorer (Version 2004, OS Build 19041.1052).

Android in two different cell phones were used .....

The following tools were used to validate the files of the website:

## **HTML Files**

# 9 . Bugs

Some bugs were related to positioning of elements in the page. They were fixed by assigning proper values, most of them with the help of a temporary background colour for the element.

Then, many minor bugs were solved just by assigning the correct property or by trial and error.

Bugs who required more time and specific solutions are the following ones:

| Bug | Solution |
| ---- | ---- |
| The quiz was not able to read and compute the correct value of the answer | The issue was caused by an improper use of the textContent property, which replaced the content of the "p" element deleting its inner "span" elements. Solved with the help of the Code Institute's material by using the innerHTML property, where values for computation were read with the value property. | 
| Stray start tag script | It was actually caused by the closing body tag placed before the end of the HTML file, leaving some scripts tags outside the body tag. Solved by moving the closing tag to the end, just before the closing html tag. Solved with https://validator.w3.org/ .|

# 10 . Deployment

The website was fully written in Gitpod, permanently tested with Gitpod preview, and periodically deployed to GigHub Pages (in a main branch).

The fully deployment to be accessible by anyone is found [here](https://csc7.github.io/asdfsdfs), whose URL is https://csc7.github.io/PP2_asdfsdfs/ .

Based on the Code Institute's Love Running project content, the following steps has been applied to have the front-end final version deployed:
1. Select website repository in GitHub account.
2. Go to "Settings" (up in the menu, to the right).
3. Select "Pages" in the menu on the left.
4. At the beginning, in "Source", select "Branch: main", and click "Save".
5. The URL address of the deployed website will appear on top of the page, as can be observed in the screenshot below in the drop-down item.

<details>
    <summary>GitHub Pages Screenshot</summary>

![Deployment on GitHub Pages Image](docs/GitHub-Pages.PNG) 
</details>

\
After first deployment, several updates have been carried out before the final version. These updates were implemented in the deployed website from Gitpod, just by using the "push" command for every commit (change) in the ongoing development.
