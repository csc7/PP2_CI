GC - The Green Company
This website is about a fictitious company. Except for the content referenced in this README file, all content is invented by me, anything matching reality is just a coincidence.

This repository belongs to my first milestone project in the Full-stack Development course at Code Institute, covering HTML and CSS along with Git version control and other design tools.

The live link for this project is this one (https://csc7.github.io/PP1_CI_TGC/).

1 . Project Goals
The goal of the project is to develop a website for a company that provides several geophysical services for diverse projects in the current energy transition towards greener energies and less CO2 emissions.

Specifically, the goals of the project are the following ones:

To build a website that provides users a summarised view of the company and the services it offers.
To provide a point of contact for offering (by the company) and for requesting (by clients) services.
To build a website where navigation is easy and intuitive.
To offer an easy call to action for requesting services.
To build a website which is itself an advertising tool.
To have a good design, in line with company's services.
To have the website visible in search engines.

2 . User Experience
UX has been addressed (and remains as a constant activity) around Jesse James Garrett's process, whose five planes involves the following matters:

STRATEGY: to build a website (product) for a company who wants to sell services.
SCOPE: the minimum viable product needs to include features that allow the user to know the following:
Basic organisational information about the company.
Which services it provides.
How to contact the company.
How to request services.
Be informed about the latest news.
STRUCTURE: the information is structured as follows:
Basic organisational information about the company: in a separate page.
Services it provides, in a separate page.
How to contact the company: both in a separate page and in a fixed button.
How to request services: in a fixed button.
Be informed about the latest news: in the home page.
SKELETON: the information is accessed through a fixed navigation menu on top of the pages, which in addition has a button to request services.
SURFACE: the website is based on green colours (to be in line with the company activity and name), contains images and a video related to its activity, and will summarise information in tables as much as possible.
User Goals
To know services being offered at a glance.
To find a website with a simple way of requesting services.
To easily contact the company.
To get basic information of the company.
Rather than a long description of the services, to have basic information with a fast method for requesting them.
To easily find company's contact details.
To navigate the website intuitively, without issues.

Organisation/Site Owner Goals
To capture clients.
To sell services.
To have a simple website where users do not "get lost" when navigating.
To show all services that the company offers in a summarised way.
To provide basic information of the structure of the company.
To receive consultations from potential clients.
To provide a simple contact form where clients feel that privacy is respected.

3 . Design Choices
The design was planned to cover screen sizes from 320x568px to 1920x1370px.

Colours
Green is the main colour of the project. The reason for this selection is to be in line with the nature of the company (whose services are focused in the current energy transition) and with the name of the company: The Green Company.

The background colour is green/grey, rgb(186, 233, 227), in order to have contrast with the content of the website while keeping the green-colour tendency of the design.

Back to Index
Fonts
Google fonts (please see credits section below) were implemented in the website. Roboto was selected for the paragraph as it is modern and easy to read. Following Google's recommendations, Baloo Tammudu 2 was also selected as complement for the titles. Arial font is used as a back-up in case the previous fonts cannot be loaded.

Colour #003300 (dark green) was selected for the body in order to have strong contrast with the white background of the body. To differentiate the navigation menu and the request service button, #135f13 (different dark green) is selected, while #276609 is selected to highlight all headings.

The name of the company in the logo uses #73ac3e to have a unique colour.

Back to Index
Structure
Following expectations of the owner, the metadata includes the following keywords to help search engines to find the website: geophysics, services, modelling, acquisition, processing, wind, geothermal, carbon, capture, CO2, operations. In addition, to help find the developer and this project, the following keywords are added: Code Institute, software development, student, full-stack course, milestone project.

The name of the company along with the name of the page are included in the head element (in the title) in order to comply with the expectations of the owner.

The visible websites is organised in a header, a body and a footer.

Wireframes were developed at the beginning in order to have a first design of the website.

Header
In order to achieve the goals related to easiness and/or simplicity, a fixed navigation area in the header is provided. In the same area, the company's logo is place to the left, and a "quick" button to request services on the right, so users are able to contract services in a very fast way.

This "quick" button, whose name is "Request Service", pops up a modal form (taken from Bootstrap, please see credits section below) where the user is able to contract specific services.

Body
The body of the pages are structured as follows for each of the pages:

Home:
It contains an environmental-friendly background video with a slogan of the company and the services it offers.

About Us:
It has an upper section, divided in three subsections, where a picture, title and text for Mission, Values and Vision are allocated. In order to keep symmetry as accurate as possible, Values (which are shown in a list) are located in the middle.
This section is followed, downwards, by another section (which lies in the middle of the body) that contains a table with the last projects of the company (those in year 2021).
Finally, at the bottom of the body, there is another section that contains a table that shows the amount of people per department in the company.
The designed is carried out for a screen size of 1024x1536 pixels (double in vertical length than the home page).

Our services:
It contains pictures in a carousel (taken from Bootstrap, please see credit sections below).
Below, in a section, there are columns that contain the titles of the services and text for each of them.
They are structured in a 3x2 arrange for desktop and tablet presentations, and 1x6 for mobile devices.

Contact Us:
On the left, there is a form where the users are able to send consultations. It has options to avoid marketing communications and being contacted by telephone, as expected by users.
On the right, there is a map of the office (above) and contact details can be found below the map.
This page has a background picture of the office.

Footer
The footer contains links for social media and company's principal e-mail of contact.

9 . Bugs
The most common bugs through development were related to positioning of elements in the page. They were fixed by assigning proper values, most of them with the help of a temporary background colour for the element.

Then, many minor bugs were solved just by assigning the correct property or by trial and error.

Bugs who required more time and specific solutions are the following ones:

Bug	Solution
aria-labelledby attribute not pointing to an local element (in current document)	Changed the attribute value to point to the ID element of the modal button in the section/project (exampleModalCenter). Solved with https://validator.w3.org/ .
Stray start tag script	It was actually caused by the closing body tag placed before the end of the HTML file, leaving some scripts tags outside the body tag. Solved by moving the closing tag to the end, just before the closing html tag. Solved with https://validator.w3.org/ .
Use h1 element as a top-level heading only	Change headings from h1 and h2 to h2 and h3. Solved with https://validator.w3.org/ .
Modal showing below other elements, in the background	Assigned z-index values to affected elements, being -1 for the modal pop-up window.
The fist design of the contact form had it positioned on the right of the Contact Us page, which cause a poor responsive behaviour	Designed changed, contact form on the left, and map and contact details on the right.
carousel-item class with text "jumped" when changing items on Latest News section	Set height property to avoid this "jump" behaviour.
Images in Our Services page carousel did not appear	Applied specificity in text carousel to select the images.
Text not showing in carousel for mobile screen sizes	Removed the "d-none" "d-md-block" classes from carousel items. Solved using Stack Overflow, accessed on June 22nd, 2021, at 3:46, at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42451739/bootstrap-4-carousel-caption-is-not-visible-on-small-devices .
Underline on Latest News titles showing blue when hovering on them, which should be white, as the colour of the title	Selected element in CSS file (after inspecting it with Chrome DevTools) and put properties color to white and text-decoration to underline.

10 . Deployment
The website was fully written in Gitpod, permanently tested with Gitpod preview, and periodically deployed to GigHub Pages (in a main branch).

The fully deployment to be accessible by anyone is found here, whose URL is https://csc7.github.io/PP1_CI_TGC/ .

Based on the Code Institute's Love Running project content, the following steps has been applied to have the front-end final version deployed:

Select website repository in GitHub account.
Go to "Settings" (up in the menu, to the right).
Select "Pages" in the menu on the left.
At the beginning, in "Source", select "Branch: main", and click "Save".
The URL address of the deployed website will appear on top of the page, as can be observed in the screenshot below in the drop-down item.
GitHub Pages Screenshot

After first deployment, several updates have been carried out before the final version. These updates were implemented in the deployed website from Gitpod, just by using the "push" command for every commit (change) in the ongoing development.
