#Wavelet Website
This website is about wavelet theory and generation. Except for the content referenced in this README file and/or the code and/or the website, all content is invented by me, anything matching reality is just a coincidence.

This repository belongs to my second milestone project in the Full-stack Development course at Code Institute, covering HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with Git version control and other software technologies.

- To provide a point of contact for offering (by the company) and for requesting (by clients) services.
- To build a website where navigation is easy and intuitive.
- To offer an easy call to action for requesting services.
- To build a website which is itself an advertising tool.
- To have a good design, in line with company's services.
- To have the website visible in search engines.

# **2 . User Experience**

UX has been addressed (and remains as a constant activity) around Jesse James Garrett's process, whose five planes involves the following matters:
- **STRATEGY**: to build a website (product) for a company who wants to sell services.
- **SCOPE**: the minimum viable product needs to include features that allow the user to know the following:
    - Basic organisational information about the company.
    - Which services it provides.
    - How to contact the company.
    - How to request services.
    - Be informed about the latest news.
- **STRUCTURE**: the information is structured as follows:
    - Basic organisational information about the company: in a separate page.
    - Services it provides, in a separate page.
    - How to contact the company: both in a separate page and in a fixed button.
    - How to request services: in a fixed button.
    - Be informed about the latest news: in the home page.
- **SKELETON**: the information is accessed through a fixed navigation menu on top of the pages, which in addition has a button to request services.
- **SURFACE**: the website is based on green colours (to be in line with the company activity and name), contains images and a video related to its activity, and will summarise information in tables as much as possible.

## **User Goals**
- To know services being offered at a glance.
- To find a website with a simple way of requesting services.
- To easily contact the company.
- To get basic information of the company.
- Rather than a long description of the services, to have basic information with a fast method for requesting them.
- To easily find company's contact details.
- To navigate the website intuitively, without issues.

#### [Back to Index](#index)

## **Organisation/Site Owner Goals**
- To capture clients.
- To sell services.
- To have a simple website where users do not "get lost" when navigating.
- To show all services that the company offers in a summarised way.
- To provide basic information of the structure of the company.
- To receive consultations from potential clients.
- To provide a simple contact form where clients feel that privacy is respected.

#### [Back to Index](#index)

## **User Stories**
User stories are divided into the following three groups:

- ### **First time users**
1. As a client, I want to know what services I can hire, so do not need to ask for more information to learn their services.
2. As a client, I want to see a list of projects that has been carried out by the company, so I have an idea if they are able to address my own projects.
3. As a client, I want to know the size of the company at a glance, in order to know if the company has resources to achieve my projects.
4. As a client, I want to have an easy option to contract services, so I do not need to go through long procedures.
5. As jobseeker, I want to know where the main office is located, to know if a move is needed in case I get a job.
6. As an equipment seller, I want to have a way to contact the company, to know if there might be any product of interest to them.
7. As a client, I want to have a contact form to make general consultations in case I do not find what I am looking for.
8. As a client, I want to have a fixed navigation menu on top, so I do not get lost when looking for information.
9. As a client, I want to see a phrase that summarizes the activity of the company, so I know from the beginning if I am in the correct website.

- ### **Returning users**
10. As a client, I want to be updated with the latest news of the company, in order to know company's performance and understand current and future capabilities.
11. As a client, I want to easily contact them in order to address any issue with my requests.
12. As a client, I want to know what the last projects are, so I have an idea of how they are performing in the marked.
13. As a client, I want to know the size of the company, to check its evolution through time and infer if they are growing or are not.

- ### **Organisation/Site Owner**
14. As owner, I want to briefly show my services, so I promote our company and clients know what can be hired.
15. As owner, I want to offer a quick call to action through a button, so clients can easily contract my services.
16. As owner, I want to give a short description of my mission, values and vision, so clients known in advance my profile before closing a deal.
17. As owner, I want to show my latest news, so I keep transparency and perform my own advertising.
18. As owner, I want to inform about my structure, so clients know in advance if my company will be able to address their needs.
19. As owner, I want to inform of my last projects, so I promote our company and simultaneously show clients about my capabilities.
20. As owner, I want an easy way to be contacted, so clients can consult their matters and do not see my company as a complicated option to get information or to request services.
21. As owner, I want my brand to be promoted and reinforced, so users associate geophysical services for the energy transition with my company.
22. As owner, I want to show where my office is, so users know where to contact and find me.
23. As owner, I want users to have a direct link in the latest news (to the corresponding sections), so they immediately relate the news with the corresponding part of the company without "getting lost" in other areas.

# **3 . Design Choices**

The design was planned to cover screen sizes from 320x568px to 1920x1370px.

## **Colours**
Green is the main colour of the project. The reason for this selection is to be in line with the nature of the company (whose services are focused in the current energy transition) and with the name of the company: The Green Company.

The background colour is green/grey, rgb(186, 233, 227), in order to have contrast with the content of the website while keeping the green-colour tendency of the design.

#### [Back to Index](#index)

## **Fonts**
Google fonts (please see credits section below) were implemented in the website. Roboto was selected for the paragraph as it is modern and easy to read. Following Google's recommendations, Baloo Tammudu 2 was also selected as complement for the titles.
Arial font is used as a back-up in case the previous fonts cannot be loaded.

Colour #003300 (dark green) was selected for the body in order to have strong contrast with the white background of the body.
To differentiate the navigation menu and the request service button,  #135f13 (different dark green) is selected, while #276609 is selected to highlight all headings.

The name of the company in the logo uses #73ac3e to have a unique colour.

#### [Back to Index](#index)

## **Structure**
Following expectations of the owner, the metadata includes the following keywords to help search engines to find the website: geophysics, services, modelling, acquisition, processing, wind, geothermal, carbon, capture, CO2, operations. In addition, to help find the developer and this project, the following keywords are added: Code Institute, software development, student, full-stack course, milestone project.

The name of the company along with the name of the page are included in the head element (in the title) in order to comply with the expectations of the owner.

The visible websites is organised in a header, a body and a footer.

Wireframes were developed at the beginning in order to have a first design of the website.

- ### **Header**

In order to achieve the goals related to easiness and/or simplicity, a fixed navigation area in the header is provided. In the same area, the company's logo is place to the left, and a "quick" button to request services on the right, so users are able to contract services in a very fast way.

This "quick" button, whose name is "Request Service", pops up a modal form (taken from Bootstrap, please see credits section below) where the user is able to contract specific services.

    This section is followed, downwards, by another section (which lies in the middle of the body) that contains a table with the last projects of the company (those in year 2021).\
    Finally, at the bottom of the body, there is another section that contains a table that shows the amount of people per department in the company.\
    The designed is carried out for a screen size of 1024x1536 pixels (double in vertical length than the home page).
- #### *Our services:*
    It contains pictures in a carousel (taken from Bootstrap, please see credit sections below).\
    Below, in a section, there are columns that contain the titles of the services and text for each of them.\

# 9 . Bugs

The most common bugs through development were related to positioning of elements in the page. They were fixed by assigning proper values, most of them with the help of a temporary background colour for the element.

Then, many minor bugs were solved just by assigning the correct property or by trial and error.

Bugs who required more time and specific solutions are the following ones:

| Bug | Solution |
| ---- | ---- |
| aria-labelledby attribute not pointing to an local element (in current document) | Changed the attribute value to point to the ID element of the modal button in the section/project (exampleModalCenter). Solved with https://validator.w3.org/ . | 
| Stray start tag script | It was actually caused by the closing body tag placed before the end of the HTML file, leaving some scripts tags outside the body tag. Solved by moving the closing tag to the end, just before the closing html tag. Solved with https://validator.w3.org/ .|
| Use h1 element as a top-level heading only | Change headings  from h1 and h2 to h2 and h3. Solved with https://validator.w3.org/ .|
| Modal showing below other elements, in the background | Assigned z-index values to affected elements, being -1 for the modal pop-up window. |
|    The fist design of the contact form had it positioned on the right of the Contact Us page, which cause a poor responsive behaviour | Designed changed, contact form on the left, and map and contact details on the right.|
| carousel-item class with text "jumped" when changing items on Latest News section| Set height property to avoid this "jump" behaviour. |
| Images in Our Services page carousel did not appear | Applied specificity in text carousel to select the images. |
| Text not showing in carousel for mobile screen sizes | Removed the "d-none" "d-md-block" classes from carousel items. Solved using Stack Overflow, accessed on June 22nd, 2021, at 3:46, at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42451739/bootstrap-4-carousel-caption-is-not-visible-on-small-devices .|
| Underline on Latest News titles showing blue when hovering on them, which should be white, as the colour of the title | Selected element in CSS file (after inspecting it with Chrome DevTools) and put properties color to white and text-decoration to underline.|

# 10 . Deployment

The website was fully written in Gitpod, permanently tested with Gitpod preview, and periodically deployed to GigHub Pages (in a main branch).

The fully deployment to be accessible by anyone is found [here](https://csc7.github.io/PP1_CI_TGC/), whose URL is https://csc7.github.io/PP1_CI_TGC/ .

Based on the Code Institute's Love Running project content, the following steps has been applied to have the front-end final version deployed:
1. Select website repository in GitHub account.
2. Go to "Settings" (up in the menu, to the right).
3. Select "Pages" in the menu on the left.
4. At the beginning, in "Source", select "Branch: main", and click "Save".
5. The URL address of the deployed website will appear on top of the page, as can be observed in the screenshot below in the drop-down item.

<details>
    <summary>GitHub Pages Screenshot</summary>

</details>

\
After first deployment, several updates have been carried out before the final version. These updates were implemented in the deployed website from Gitpod, just by using the "push" command for every commit (change) in the ongoing development.
